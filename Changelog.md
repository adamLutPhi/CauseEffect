## Plan Action

- I noticed that `few functions` Matter The Most, they were the kernel that sparked  the `initial passion`, that struck into me,

- Hence all the power, from now on, should be entirely focused on those i.e. `Rockstar Functions`, that I have dreamt on finishing.

- Today, I created `unUsed2.jl`, to make `unUsed.jl` a bit more breathable

## Days Quote
    "Small Victories Count Big"
### final notes

- Falling into mediocrity is highly possible

- Being able to track every line of code, remembering **why I did that**, at a Particular time
- like something I do , i.e. `cause` function, that takes `currentValue`,
it was `wanted`, at some point, at a particular Time & Space , but now, not a bit. Quite the contrary, the Requirement of a Good Software has shifted

- Now , I have to do extra, to  go back , remind self what **good things I have had** about each `code block`, then try to reconstruact that. Others would soon follow (like dominos)
    "small Victories count big", just you gotta not lose hope, nor patience, when time of war comes"

- Maybe life is `self-contradictory`, after all, that's what the Best  functions, when look into them, from a different light,  turn to,  a `depreciable`, unnecessary code,

- What way, frustrating is, the more beautiful code is nealy `1 Mile` away, from where I was (there's also the `risk of getting lost` - that I didn't give enough thought to it, ye)

- (However, I would only delete a code , if it has proven that it has truly `no use` & holds `no value` )

- I know (or have an idea about) what the `Main problem` with my code was , but I will defer taking about it, until I'm at the seashore, again  

- let's try to make it simple, as I once have imagined it, before some exogeneous event that flips the table, & changes every t, shall we?

## Day's quote
**be Careful what you wish for**

## Preface
Here we are , yet again
Another day in, Another hardwork out  (yet to see the sun)

## Action Plan
### Added

`objBounds(_view,arr)`

Although first seems to be as `_view`, input parameters are of type `any`,
So, they could be of any type , that's what that line on the website would say

# 9-5-2022

## Action Plan

### Updated

`objBounds(arr)`
    corrected function output

`objBounds(_view,arr)`
    corrected its return

# 9-7-2022
## Action Plan

### added
 `lineLengthAcceptable(a,b,_length)`
To add consistency, keeping it simple, & not repeating thyself

### corrected
the `swapContent` return output parameters
it was primarily mistakenly left as array content, but got changed into
array indicies , with a contentSwapped bool, as a third parameter

## Next Action Plan

Have to depreciate every `_view` ,
and replace it the debugged `objBounds`
