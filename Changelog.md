A part of code sharing seems to be also a chance for an `experience Sharing` as well, thus it's important for me to stick with a log, this time, sharing the love with whomever reading those lines . From all of my heart, 
Thank You 

## overview 
I've started working on an old project, a  while ago
gotta say, it's all dusty, it requires to be cleaned inside out , from  the bottom pit of pits, going up

**Background** 
We had some of the most brightful tutors (of language), back in France. But what was more intriguing were some their qustions , while some were quite remarkable to note , down , & to ponder unpon.
"say, what happens when you meet a new vocabulary, and have no dictionary on you, what do you do, then? "
-the question was open-ended, no right or wrong it seems to me 
**"I repeat it "**
**"oh, "** the tutor *exclaimed* **"so only by repeating it in your mind** , would that **be enough for you to understand?"**
*-"I guess "*
(all conversations in french, translated, to best English equivalnce one could think of)

    "by only repteition, new things open up,
    new forms start to self-emerge, out of no-where, straight for the Abyss"
that statement alone kept teasing me
- How would , a seemingly fresh **word** tell me **its contents?** - that was , truly, the question. 

the same is true for functions , as words are functions ,
in programming realm functions should act, serve & help a higher purpose, some reason behind it , I could not think of *(whereas I only could visualize the end product, the inputs , & outputs, that's much of it, so to speak)* 

maybe a higher cause , one I 
While I've Started this project, at a previous stage, it  more or less **recreational, idea-dependent**, i.e. if an **Idea is good**, then stick to it, keep  pursuing, until you reach the bottom pit; refresh, & retry, maybe watch your code again, then repeat. Repeat, until, a (another) New idea shows up, and follow it down its pit. 

- As easy as that might sound, but by far, that was the craziest idea I have conducted.

- while it's nice having all the `Faux Bijoux` with its fake shine, all that  tell us it's not that interesting,

- what would have been is if I could have payed attention to every corner I've encountered, since the debut of this repository 

- The intention now to solve the main prgram issues, as much as the program requires, because 

    "good ideas, emerging from the realm of the dead,  die hard"

- Behind each idea is a long trail, like a line , missing in the middle of the forest, it seems to have no start, nor a proper end.
- so the craftsaman must be prepared. Otherwise, confusion & loss would be awaiting for him, (but if everything goes as planned, when that happens, then `life would be truly bland, n'est pas?` )

 - More often than not,  I've been trying to clutch on ideas, one after another , that seemed to render me as  `unsatiable`

- indeed, there is greed for money, greed for education (& learning), greed for wisdom, but also there is greed for Code - yes, in this time & age, now I must say it exists, as well *(no need to mention physical side-effects for the sum spoken is too  much for a regular to fully comprehend, (you don;t have to, and thank you for trying )*

- in the end, I aws follwing  a unicorn? well, it's more like  a `rhino`, defenitely, wouldm't obey. just because it's a beautiful  to watch! I followed it regardless all warnings even my body started to indicate 


## Plan Action 

- I noticed a few of functions matter the most, they were the kernel of the initial passion that struck into me,

- hence all the power, from now on, should be entirely focused on those i.e. `rockstar functions`, that I have dreamt on finishing.

- Today, I created `Unused2.jl`, to make `unUsed.jl` a bit more breathable 

## Days Quote
    "small victories count big"
### final notes 

- Falling into mediocrity is highly possible 

- Being able to track every line of code, remembering **why I did that**, at a particular time
- like sth I do , i.e. `cause` function that takes `currentValue` , it was `wanted`, at a particular time & space , but now, not a bit. Quite the contrary, the requirement of a good software has shifted

- Now , I have to do extra, to  go back , remind self what **good things I have had** about each code block , then try to reconstract that. Others would soon follow (like dominos)
    "small vitories count big", just you gotta not to lost hope nor patience when time of war comes "

- Maybe life is `self-contradictory`, afterall, that's what ven the best  functions, when look into from a differnt light,  turn to , a `depreciable`, unnecessary code 
- what's way frustrating is the more beautiful code is nealy 1 mile away from where I was (there's also the risk of getting lost - that I didn't give enough thought to )

- (however, I would only delete a code , if it has proven that it has truly no use & holds no value )

- I know (or have an idea about) what the `Main problem` with my code was , but I will defer taking about it, until I'm a the seashore again  

- let's try to make it simple, as I once have imagined it, shall we?

## Day's quote
**becareful what you wish for**

## Preface
Here we are , yet again
another day in, another hardwork out  (yet to see the sun)




## Action Plan

### Added 

`objBounds(_view,arr)`

although first seems to be as `_view` bot bot input parameters are of type `any`, 
so they could be of any type
