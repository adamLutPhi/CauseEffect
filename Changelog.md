A part of code-sharing seems to be also a chance for an `experience Sharing` as well, thus it's important for me to stick with a log, this time, sharing the love with whomever reading those lines. From all of my heart,
Thank You

## overview
I've started working on an old project, a  while ago
gotta say, it's all dusty, requires to be cleaned,  inside out , from  the bottom pit of pits, going up

**Background**

We had some of the most brightful tutors (of language), back in France.
calm, some times funny,
But what was more intriguing were some of their qustions, while some were quite remarkable to note down, & to ponder upon:

"Say, what happens when you meet a *new vocabulary, and have no dictionary on you . . . What do you do, then? "

-   the question  was open-ended, no right or wrong it seems to me
-**"I repeat it "**
**"oh, "** the tutor *exclaimed* **"so only by repeating it in your mind** , would that **be enough for you to understand?"**
*-"I guess "*
(All conversations in French, translated, to best English equivalnce one could think of)

    *"by only repteition*, new things open-up,
    new forms start to **self-emerge**, out of no-where, straight for the Abyss"
that statement alone kept teasing me
- How would , a seemingly fresh **word** tell me **its contents?** - that was , truly, the question.

  The same is true for functions, as words are functions
In the programming realm, functions should act, serve & help a higher purpose. Some reason behind it, I could not think of *(whereas I only could visualize the end product, the inputs, & outputs, that's much of it, so to speak)*

   Maybe, there is a `higher cause`, one I ...
While I've Started this project, at a previous stage,
it was  more or less **recreational, idea-dependent**, i.e., if an **Idea is good**, then Stick to it, keep  pursuing, until you reach the bottom pit; refresh, & retry, maybe watch your code again, then repeat. Repeat, until, a (another) New idea shows up, and follow it down to its pit. - (it has to, it always will), that's what the mind is good for, after all... `drawing ideas`


- As easy as that might sound, but by far, that was the craziest idea I have conducted.

- While it's nice having all the `Faux Bijoux` with its fake shine, all that help tell us it's not that interesting,

- What would have been is, if I could have payed Attention to every corner I've encountered, since the debut of this repository

- The intention now is to go back , where I left things, to solve
 the main program issues, as much as the program requires, because

    "good ideas, emerging from the realm of the dead,  die hard"

- Behind each idea is a long trail of other things, untold. Like a line , missing in the middle of the `forest`, it seems to have no start, and yet, nor a proper end.
- so the craftsaman, must he be prepared. Otherwise, confusion & loss would be awaiting, for him. But if everything goes as planned, when that happens, then `life would be truly bland, n'est pas?` )

 - More often than not,  I've been trying to clutch on ideas, one after another , that seemed to render me as  `unsatiable`

- Indeed, there is greed for money, greed for education (& learning), greed for wisdom, but also there is greed for... Code - yes, in this time & age, now I must say it exists, as well
one time been behind the screen all day, forgot the last time going to the loo. with a hand, feeling the eye sockets, I think they got smaller over the time being.

 *(no need to mention physical side-effects for the sum spoken is too  much for a regular to fully comprehend, (you don't have to, and Thank you for trying )*

- In the end, was I following a `Unicorn`? well, it's more like a `Rhino`, definitely, wouldn't obey. Just because it's beautiful  to watch! I followed it regardless all warnings even my body started to indicate that.


## Plan Action

- I noticed that `few functions` Matter The Most, they were the kernel that sparked  the `initial passion`, that struck into me,

- Hence all the power, from now on, should be entirely focused on those i.e. `Rockstar Functions`, that I have dreamt on finishing.

- Today, I created `unUsed2.jl`, to make `unUsed.jl` a bit more breathable

## Days Quote
    "Small Victories Count Big"
### final notes

- Falling into mediocrity is highly possible

- Being able to track every line of code, remembering **why I did that**, at a Particular time
- like something I do , i.e. `cause` function, that takes `currentValue`,
it was `wanted`, at some point, at a particular Time & Space , but now, not a bit. Quite the contrary, the Requirement of a Good Software has shifted

- Now , I have to do extra, to  go back , remind self what **good things I have had** about each `code block`, then try to reconstruact that. Others would soon follow (like dominos)
    "small Victories count big", just you gotta not lose hope, nor patience, when time of war comes"

- Maybe life is `self-contradictory`, after all, that's what the Best  functions, when look into them, from a different light,  turn to,  a `depreciable`, unnecessary code,

- What way, frustrating is, the more beautiful code is nealy `1 Mile` away, from where I was (there's also the `risk of getting lost` - that I didn't give enough thought to it, ye)

- (However, I would only delete a code , if it has proven that it has truly `no use` & holds `no value` )

- I know (or have an idea about) what the `Main problem` with my code was , but I will defer taking about it, until I'm at the seashore, again  

- let's try to make it simple, as I once have imagined it, before some exogeneous event that flips the table, & changes every t, shall we?

## Day's quote
**be Careful what you wish for**

## Preface
Here we are , yet again
Another day in, Another hardwork out  (yet to see the sun)

## Action Plan
### Added

`objBounds(_view,arr)`

Although first seems to be as `_view`, input parameters are of type `any`,
So, they could be of any type , that's what that line on the website would say

# 9-5-2022

## Action Plan

### Updated

`objBounds(arr)`
    corrected function output

`objBounds(_view,arr)`
    corrected its return

# 9-7-2022
## Action Plan

### added
 `lineLengthAcceptable(a,b,_length)`
To add consistency, keeping it simple, & not repeating thyself

### corrected
the `swapContent` return output parameters
it was primarily mistakenly left as array content, but got changed into
array indicies , with a contentSwapped bool, as a third parameter

# 9-7-2022

## Action Plan

### replaced
`oldschoolSwap` with `swapContent`, as the intent was to replace content, if proven to be bigger
### Corrected
`elementAt` ouputs

### depreciated
`calcVerteciesLeft!`  , `isStoppingCondition` , `traverse` , `mappedIndex`, `collect`,  `checkCond` , `checkCondition` , `collect`
all depreciated functions are moved into `unUsed.jl`


# 9-12-2022

## Action Plan

### Corrected

=`swapContent` inner function logic (so that function enters)

### Removed

- Unnecessary `half-Comment` operators `#=` and `=#` across the `Utils.jl` (From Uneven Commenting ) 

Now, `Utils.jl` output displays the main issue:
`boundError` -   to be dealt with

### Updated
- `Unused.jl`
- `makeVector` into the built-in `collect`

# 9-17-2022

## Action Plan

## Updated 

- `UnUsed2`: files from `Utils` has been Transferred for it
-  `Utils` : removed non-functional code
- `demo`: spaces been addded 

# 9-18-2022

## Action Plan 

## Updated 
- `novelApproach`:  requires more work on debugging 
## Next Action Plan

- Recheck `elementAt` output

- Depreciate every `_view` ,
and replace it the debugged `objBounds`
