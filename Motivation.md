## overview

I've started working on an old project, a  while ago
gotta say, it's all dusty, requires cleaning,  inside out , from  the bottom pit of pits, going up

**Background**

We had some of the most brightful tutors (of language), back in France, `Jan`
calm, some times funny
But what was more intriguing were some of their qustions :
while some were quite remarkable to note down, and to ponder upon:

"Say, what happens when you meet a *new vocabulary*, and have no dictionary on you . . . What do you do, then? "

- the question  was open-ended, no right or wrong it seemed
-**"I repeat it "**
**"oh, "** the tutor *exclaimed* **"so only by repeating it in your mind** , would that **be enough for you to understand?"**
*-"I guess "*
*"by only repteition*, new things open-up,
(New forms start to **self-emerge**, out of no-where, straight for the Abyss")
that statement alone kept teasing me
- How would , a seemingly fresh **word** tell me **its contents?** - that was , truly, the question.

  The same is true for functions: as words are functions, they transform, and change . If code is sick, it won't work as it should.
In the programming realm, functions should act, serve & help a higher purpose. Some reason behind
As the saying goes:  *( only could visualize the end product, the inputs, & outputs, that's much of it, so to speak)*
   Maybe, there is a `higher cause`, one I ...
While this project was started, at a previous stage,
It was  more or less **recreational, idea-dependent**, i.e., if an **Idea is good**, then Stick to it, keep  pursuing, until you reaching that holly bottom pit;
refresh, & retry
Watch the code again, it's not a `Monet` painting, just a few functions away to complete to be completed
Rinse & repeat, until, a (another) New idea shows up, and follow it down to its pit.
 **(it has to, always will)**, that's what the mind is good for, after all... `drawing ideas`

- As easy as that might sound, but by far, that was the craziest idea started, the feeling completing a function 

- While it's nice having all the `Faux Bijoux` (Fake Jewlery) with its fake shine, all that help tell us it's not that interesting,

- if I **could have payed *Much Attention* to every corner encountered, since the debut of this repository

- The intention, now , is to go back , where things are left of , waiting to get solved
 the main program issues, as much as the program requires, because

    "good ideas, emerging from the realm of the dead,  die hard"

- Behind each idea is a long trail of other things, untold. Like a line , missing, in the middle of the `forest`, where there is no start, and yet, nor a proper end.
- So the craftsaman, must he be prepared. Otherwise, confusion & loss would be awaiting. But if everything goes as planned, when that happens, then `life would be truly bland, n'est pas?` )

- More often than not,  I've been trying to clutch on ideas, one after another , that seemed to render self `unsatiable`

- Indeed, there is greed for money, greed for education (& learning), greed for wisdom, but also there is greed for... Code - yes, in this time & age, now I must say it exists, as well
one time been behind the screen all day, forgot the last time had a sip of water, or eve going to the washroom. with a hand, sensing the eye sockets, getting smaller, over a while.




- Were I following a `Unicorn`? well, it's more like a `Rhino`, definitely, wouldn't obey. Just because it's beautiful to watch, regardless all warnings even my body started to show.
 "To learn, and then to practise opportunely what one has learnt... Does not this bring with it a sense of satisfaction?" - Confucius, the Analetics
I guess, practise surely is a previlage , but to fix a bug, is an addiction of another kind, that's worth the whole trip!

this is an opportinuty not only for code-sharing, but also a chance for an `experience Sharing` as well,
thus it's important for me to stick with a `log`,
this time, sharing the love with whomever reading those lines. From all of my heart,
Thank You
